                    <h3>How to Start Speaking at Tech Events</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h7>10 meaningful actions you can take to break into the tech speaker circuit</h7>
                    <p>Speaking at tech events is rewarding for folks for various reasons: sharing, seeking feedback on early
                        ideas, networking, working on public speaking skills or training to be a professional speaker, building
                        credibility, hiring, getting hired, etc. If one or more of these applies to you, here are ten meaningful
                        actions you can take to break into the tech speaker circuit and build your personal tech credibility.</p>
                    <div class="ol">
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <b>Do research and hone your niche- </b>This is hands down the most time consuming step and
                                the most important. Many successful speakers don’t start out seeking to speak. They attend
                                events and topics that interest them, and once they’ve recognized underdeveloped niches in
                                the information sharing market, they start to speak on them. Hot topics can be identified
                                a few ways. I look at Google Trends to see how often something is searched for. I also look
                                through upcoming conference agendas to see what topics they are centering their event around
                                as those teams do copious amounts of research to find topics that appeal to their target
                                attendee audience. This resource also exposes gaps in the ecosystem. For example, if a conference
                                has talks for artificial intelligence, but does not have any talks on chatbots under this
                                category, this could be a gap you could fill. If you start to notice a similar gap across
                                event agendas, then that is a niche you could claim.
                                <br>
                                <br>I encourage you to attend a few meetups and conferences on topics that interest you, watch
                                a few talks online, explore related content on Twitter and blogs, and take notes on why certain
                                topics and talks are more interesting to you. This will help you to find an opportunity you
                                are passionate about sharing, that others are interested in learning about.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Invest in a good headshot- </b>Some events ask for them along with your speaker application.
                                Generally, these are for their website and other advertising materials and are often required
                                to fit specific specs. Therefore, it’s best to have a few different shots and layouts available
                                for various events. These will also be good for your LinkedIn, Eventbrite, blog, Meetup,
                                and other profiles. Some events will edit your pics, and some events will post your original
                                headshot as-is.
                                <i>I put this higher in the list simply because some photographers take a bit to return your
                                    photos to you, so if you do this early, it won’t hold up your progress.
                                </i>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Demonstrate your expertise- </b>Create a cool project or product, write some code, then write
                                a few blog posts and draft a talk on the topic(s) you’d want to talk about and share them
                                on GitHub and LinkedIn.
                                <br>
                                <br>Don’t be scared away from a topic if you see a similar topic appear a couple of times. Especially
                                starting out, it is ok to overlap topics with other speakers for a few reasons.
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The speaker circuit is a global market. You can represent the local perspective on a
                                        particular topic.</li>
                                    <li>Events seek all different flavors of a topic: workshops, talks, demos to name a few.</li>
                                    <li>It’s easier to sell a totally original topic when people trust you(your speaking ability
                                        and style) and your technical expertise.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Practice your talk for anyone who will listen- </b>Practice is very important here, just
                                as it is for honing a new sport or skill. And just as athletes have games in pre-season that
                                mimic real game environments, it is important for you to mock real speaking environments
                                and audiences when you practice. Ask people to listen to you practice and try to mix your
                                audience with both people who know you well and people who know you less well.
                                <br>
                                <br> Here’s a checklist for your practice audiences to make sure you are putting on a good show:

                                <br>
                                <br> In addition to getting verbal feedback, this worksheet will help identify where to focus
                                your attention for your next practice round.
                                <br>
                                <br> Here are a couple of references for getting ready to talk:

                                <br> Remember, when you speak at a tech event, you should expect that you are on video at all
                                times. Why? Because in today’s social tech ecosystem, events and members of the audience
                                are snapping pics, video clips, and tweeting quotes from your presentation in real time.
                                One misstep can break your reputation and one strong quote or action can make you viral.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Create a profile on tech speaker sites- </b>Are you on Eventbrite, Speaker Hub, Meetup and
                                other tech speaker sites? Link your content to these profiles. Make sure to include those
                                headshots you took and any blog posts on the subject you’ve written. Create consistency between
                                your bios and content across the various speaker sites and include some information about
                                the topic you want to speak about. </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Apply to speak- </b>How do you let a tech event organizer know you’re interested? For some
                                events (usually smaller ones), message the organizers with your topic and volunteer to speak.
                                Or, if there is a formal process (like for big tech conferences), apply through their official
                                channels to speak. I’ve found that most often there is a form on the conference site for
                                speaker submissions. You can also find the organizer listed on each meetup page or conference
                                website.
                                <i>Note that some events pay speakers and cover costs for travel, accommodation, and entry to
                                    the event; while some events don’t offer any assistance. Know what you need in order
                                    to commit, even if this means consider sticking to smaller local events as you build
                                    your speaking portfolio. </i>
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Don’t be too picky- </b>Use your first couple events for continued practice and to build
                                your credibility. No audience is too small, and you can leverage these environments to try
                                new tactics out as well. Also, you never know who is in the audience… maybe the organizer
                                of a meetup you’ve had your eye on!
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <b>Crave feedback - ask for and take feedback openly- </b>Receiving critical feedback early
                                allows you the opportunity to adapt. This can help you find success as a speaker. Every time
                                you speak, ask those who watched to share their thoughts. If it’s a small crowd, you can
                                ask in person. If you are giving a talk, you can ask folks in the audience to interactively
                                provide feedback as a part of your presentation. One effective way to capture feedback that
                                I’ve witnessed was who paused and asked the audience to respond to multiple choice questions
                                throughout his talk via a SMS response of A, B, C, or D to a prompt on the presentation screen.
                                At the end of his talk, he leveraged this same channel to request feedback on his talk as
                                the audience was already engaged and warmed to this interaction model. If you are comfortable
                                with it, you can even invite folks to respond on public channels to serve as third party
                                reviews (LinkedIn, Meetup, Eventbrite, Twitter, etc.).</li>

                                <b>Share your successes- </b>Each time you speak at an event, update your profiles and share
                                that info with the next event organizer. Previous speaking engagements are a very persuasive
                                argument for organizers to “hire” you on for their event.</li>

                                <b>Manage your brand off stage- </b>Managing your brand isn’t just controlling the x minutes
                                spent on stage during your talk. You need to be a good communicator on and off the stage.
                                A few easy ways to grow and manage your reputation:
                                <br>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Respond within 48 hours to inquiries</li>
                                    <li>Make time for Q&A after your talk</li>
                                    <li>Share content frequently online or in person</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Investing in your tech brand will take time and focus, but will net you an invaluable ecosystem.
                            If you successfully execute #1-10, you’ll be well positioned to develop your individual tech
                            speaking brand and soon have tech event organizers pursuing you to request you to speak at their
                            next event. Happy speaking!
