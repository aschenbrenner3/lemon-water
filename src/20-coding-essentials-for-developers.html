                <h3>20 Tools I Don't Code Without </h3>
                <br>
                <h7>My Coding Essentials</h7>
                <br>
                <p>My kit and style has changed quite a bit since I became a Software Engineer. I use different products and leverage different tools as a Developer than I did as a Marketer. If you are just getting started as a developer, or just looking for some new swag, here are some of the engineering essentials I recommend.</p>

                <b><h6>Hardware</h6></b>
                <p>My workstation is pretty pimped out and is a pleasure to work at. I spent a lot of time researching what products would aid in health and productivity. These lucky pieces of hardware get to spend work time with me: </p>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col s12 m6">
                        <li>15" MacBook Pro w/ Touch Bar</li>
                        <li>HP ENVY 34" Curved Display</li>
                        <li>Apple Magic Trackpad</li>
                        <li>Apple Magic Keyboard</li>
                        <li>Motorized Standing Desks</li>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col s12 m6">
                        <div class ="blogimg"><img src="images/standing-desk-cropped.png"></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h6>Software</h6></b>
                <p>Not surprisingly, Software Engineers obsess over having the latest and most performant software. Strong software can save Developers a ton of time by helping complete code and automating some mundane tasks, so they can focus on fun, challenging problems. I use a lot more than 5 programs daily, but these are the 5 I use most often to help me with my coding and documentation:</p>
                <div class="blogimage"><img src="images/amanda_at_desk.jpg"><br>
                    <div class ="bulletdesc">
                        <b><li>IntelliJ</li></b><p>'An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.' <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment>Source</a> My IDE of choice for coding is IntelliJ. The other two popular IDEs seem to be Eclipse and Spring Tool Suite™. There is a free version of IntelliJ 'Community' available for those that are just starting out, but I recommend the licensed 'Ultimate' version if you decide IntelliJ is too the choice for you.</p>
                        <b><li>Terminal</li></b><p>I use the built in terminal on my MacBook as my command line interface (CLI). This is my communication tool with my computer's operating system. Simply put, I supply it with commands and my computer responds to those commands and responds to let me know what it did with the given command. If you're just getting started - I recommend taking the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line">Codeacademy class: 'Learn the Command Line'</a>.</p>
                        <b><li>Atom</li></b><p>Atom is my text editor of choice. I especially love the gamification of the 'Activate Power Mode' package available with Atom. Every character you code gives you points! Be careful not to get too carried away with your points though as it is a best practice to have shorter, cleaner code wherever possible.</p>
                        <b><li>Confluence</li></b><p>Confluence is my documentation tool of choice. It makes it really easy to whip up engineering designs and documentation for software development. Design documentation helps communicate to your team, and others consuming your API or other technology product, what technologies are leveraged and how the program flows.</p>
                        <b><li>Slack</li></b><p>Slack is a popular communication channel in Tech. It is a messaging platform that is optimized for sharing code snippets and technical documentation and has been widely adopted by technology companies. The platform facilitates instant communication and remote collaboration.</p>
                    </div>
                    <b><h6>Personal products</h6></b>
                    <p>Each Developer has his/her own style. These products accompany my day-to-day routine and reflect my personality and style. In reflection, this list highlights the my active lifestyle, health obsession and coding passion.  </p>
                    <div class="col s12 m12">
                        <div class ="blogimg"><img src="images/londonmug.jpg"></div><br>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col s12 m12">
                    <div class ="bulletdesc">
                        <b><li>Posture Coach</li></b><p>As a Developer, you spend a lot of time at your computer coding. It is easy to lean in to inspect the code, which can lead to back or other complications from bad posture. My friend that lives in Austin and works for a logistics tech startup recommended Lumolift® to me. The product is a posture coach, which reminds you to fix your posture when you are out of the ideal posture range!</p>
                        <b><li>'Cuppa' (British: cup for tea)</li></b><p>In my new role, or maybe just as I get older, I am drinking a lot more caffeine! One of the things I do to create Hygge moments at work is keep a coffee cup from home at my desk. Mine has a London landscape to bring me memories of my time there!</p>
                        <b><li>Computer Glasses</li></b><p>I spend a lot more time on the computer now. I am lucky to have 20/20 vision, but the additional time on the computer does lead to more headaches than before and I've read that just as computer time can lead to back complications, it can also lead to vision complications in the future. I use computer glasses to cut out the blue rays and glare that emit from a computer screen. They are kind of cute too! F.lux is a program that helps cut out blue light from your computer display as well.</p>
                        <b><li>Screen Wipes</li></b><p>In Software Engineering, peer programming, where more than one programmer code together, happens frequently. Working together includes time at the white board and at the screen and leads to lots of fingerprints on the laptop and monitor screens. I wipe my screen daily with computer screen wipes. </p>
                        <b><li>Bike</li></b><p>In my new role as a Software Engineer, I am a lot more conscious of my eye health than I was previously. I eat more fish and take supplements to keep these babies healthy! I have also read that one should take frequent breaks from the computer screen. To give my eyes a break during the work day, my activity of choice is biking. My employer supplies bikes on campus, so I go on a lap or two around campus as often as I can.</p>
                    </div>
                    </div>
                    <b><h6>References</h6></b>
                    <p>Software professionals use software documentation very frequently and documentation is a very important part of every Software Engineer's job. Documentation exists for languages, programs, APIs, etc. When I first started, my teacher encouraged me to read coding language documentation. It is a different style of writing than I was used to coming from Marketing, so the more exposure I received early on, the better.</p>
                    <div class ="bulletdesc">
                        <b><li>Google</li></b><p>Googling is an art in Software Engineering. Knowing how to Google the right combination of search terms is vital to finding the right help when stuck debugging or researching diverse code solutions. One recent example I have is building this website. The .html extensions were displaying in my URLs. The web page you are reading now was showing up as <code>http://lemonwater.io/20-coding-essentials.html</code>. The <code>.html</code> extension trailing my URL made me seem too novice. I wanted it to read: <code>http://lemonwater.io/20-coding-essentials</code> as it does now. I Googled various combinations of 'removing .html extensions from my code' and the top results all included solutions leveraging Apache and creating a simple .htaccess document in my project's root folder. My project isn't using Apache, so this solution was not helpful for me. Finally, after trying many search terms, I input 'removing .html extension from AWS static website', which returned me a simple solution for my particular use case. With practice, searching with the language other developers use becomes more natural.</p>
                        <b><li>AWS & Java Documentation </li></b><p>These are the two I use most often, but I have also needed to reference documentation for every language and tool I have used in my new career. Java documentation, like most coding documents, share the available methods and classes available within the language as well as instructions for leveraging the language. I have used AWS documentation for CLI commands and to learn about the various AWS services.</p>
                        <b><li>Safari Books</li></b><p>Safari Books is a large online collection of technical books, videos and other media. I have personally read books and watched videos on Java and Spark on Safari Books. The feature I really like is their Queue. The Safari Queue allows you to download media and access it offline. Perfect for all my travels!</p>
                        <b><li>Stack Overflow</li></b><p>Stack Overflow results are often returned in my Google searches as this is an online forum for tech questions and answers among the tech community. The community is pretty active, so responses to questions are pretty fast, making it an efficient solution to helping get unstuck form technical challenges one might be having. The community is encouraged to up or down vote each answer, so it is easy to identify the answer that has worked for the most people as you scan the results as well as see various solutions to the same problem. </p>
                        <b><li>GitHub</li></b><p>GitHub is a repository for code and technical documentation. The website hosts open  source and private code through their various products. The README.md file in a repository typically documents what the program is meant to do and how to consume it. GitHub allows for joint collaboration on projects and is set up to act a s a remote from your local computer, stripping out complexity is sharing and collaborating.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>I hope my list of essentials for Web Developers inspires your personal development kit and can help future newbies learn some of the vocabulary of the field. </p>
